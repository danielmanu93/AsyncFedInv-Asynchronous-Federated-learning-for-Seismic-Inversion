# AsyncFedInv-Asynchronous-Federated-learning-for-Seismic-Inversion

In this project, we proposed the Asynchronous Federated Learning for Seismic Inversion (AsyncFedInv) framework, which applies multiple IoT devices in terms of edge computing boards to collaboratively train a compact UNet model in real-time based on a novel asynchronous federated learning, where 1) a staleness function is applied to mitigate model staleness, and 2) clients that generate similar local models would suspend its training, thus reducing the communication costs and energy consumption.

The overview of the whole AnsycFedInv architecture is shown in the image below:
